        "content": "Another tumor-suppressor gene, BRCA1, has been identified at the chromosomal locus 17q21; this gene encodes a zinc finger protein, and the protein product functions as a transcription factor and is involved in gene repair. Women who inherit a mutated allele of this gene from either parent have at least a 60\u201380% lifetime chance of developing breast cancer and about a 33% chance of developing ovarian cancer. The risk is higher among women born after 1940, presumably due to promotional effects of h..."

        "content": "Genetic testing plays an important role in assessing breast cancer risk and often the risk of other types of cancers. Accurate risk assessment and stratification represents a critical element of identifying who is best served by increased surveillance and consideration of other prevention or treatment options while also limiting overtreatment and unnecessary testing. The indications for testing will likely continue to expand, and ideally, more women with a genetic predisposition to breast cancer..."

        "content": "Most studies indicate that COCs overall are not associated with an increased risk of cancer (Cibula, 2010). In fact, a protective efect against ovarian and endometrial cancer has been shown (Collaborative Group on Epidemiological Studies of Ovarian Cancer, 2008; Tsilidis, 201r1). As an exception, the relative risk of cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer is higher in current COC users, but this declines after use is discontinued. Following 10 or more years, risk returns to that of never users (..."

        "content": "Breast cancer incidence rates in women of Asian descent have been increasing in the United States (U.S.) and Asia. In a case-control study of Asian American women from the San Francisco Bay Area, we assessed associations with birthplace and migration-related characteristics and compared risk factors between Asian American and non-Hispanic White women by birthplace and birth cohort. Birthplace and migration-related characteristics were associated with breast cancer risk only among women in the yo..."
